          <strong>archibold</strong> is a zero hassle OS installer
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>
          and latest <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>,
          <em>archibold</em> has been successfully installed in many platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          These could be old or modern PCs, and even developer boards, as long as drivers are supported.<br/>
          Following an example of successful installations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Netbook with Intel® Celeron(R) CPU 847 @ 1.10GHz x 2</li>
          <li>NUC with Intel® Atom™ CPU E3815 @ 1.46GHz</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.minnowboard.org/meet-minnowboard-max/">MinnowBoard MAX</a> with Intel® Atom™ CPU E3825 @ 1.33GHz x 2</li>
          <li>Laptop (mine) with Intel® Processor 5Y70 CPU @ 1.10GHz × 4</li>
          <li>Mac Mini with Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU P8600 @ 2.40GHz x 2 (via nVidia neuveau)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1><a href="#supported-platform">Supported Platforms</a></h1>
        <p>
          Currently, <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel®</a> Hardware is the most supported one
          thanks to its drivers availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Main limitations for ARM platforms are indeed GPU drivers,
          most of the time closed source.<br/>
          If your ARM device is so cool that it has HW Accelerated drivers, please let me know!<br/>
          I'll do my best to support it seamlessly as any other Intel® device.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Platform a part, an <strong>Internet connection</strong> is mandatory and there are few options.<br/>
          Avoiding GNOME and SWAP, archibold fits into <strong>2GB</strong>.<br/>
          Setting <code>SWAP=0<code> and keeing GNOME, <strong>4GB</strong> are more than enough.<br/>
          For a fully functional Desktop environment, <strong>8GB of disk space</strong> would be enough.<br/>
          Any extra space will be available and most common external Hard Drives are supported too.
        </p>

      <section id="warning">
        <h1><a href="#warning">Warning</a></h1>
        <p>
          This installer might compromise an entire disk, if used improperly, so it comes with <strong>no warranty</strong>.<br/>
          Please be sure to understand each step before confirming anything during installation.<br/>
          Feel free to search in <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux forum</a> in case of doubts, usually all answers are already there.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="how-to">
        <h1><a href="#how-to">How To</a></h1>
        <p>
          As very first step, we need a bootable version of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">ArchLinux iso</a> through USB stick or DVD.<br/>
          We can learn how to burn it in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media#BIOS_and_UEFI_Bootable_USB">dedicated page</a>.<br/>
          Following the Linux/Mac summary where <code>/dev/sdX</code> is the USB path.
        </p>
        <pre><code># just bs=4M in Linux, older OSX has no M option
dd if=~/Downloads/archlinux-2015.02.01-dual.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4194304</code></pre>
        <p>
          Please note it might take 5 minutes or more to complete above operation, be patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once <code>dd</code> has finished, we can use the USB stick from any USB port of the target machine.<br/>
          Some target might require some extra step and it depends on the <strong>bios</strong>.<br/>
          Usually keeping pressed <strong>Esc</strong>, <strong>F2</strong>, or <strong>F10</strong>
          during boot should help reaching the boot menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boot option we are interested about is the <strong>UEFI ArchLinux</strong> one.<br/>
          If everything goes OK, we should bootstrap into a terminal/console.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <strong>extra requirement</strong> the target machine will need to be <strong>connected to the Internet</strong>.<br/>
          The preferred connection type is via <strong>network cable</strong>, but we could use WiFi too.<br/>
          However, WiFi initial configuration is a bit more advanced, I can give a hint thought:
        </p>
        <pre><code># verify wifi path
iw dev # or ip addr

# wifi path will look similar to wlp2s0
# use such name after wifi-menu
wifi-menu wlp2s0

# choose your WiFi network and enter password

# verify you are connected
ping 8.8.8.8

# PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
# 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=8.15 ms
# 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=9.36 ms
# 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=53 time=7.92 ms
# ...
# press Ctrl+C to stop the ping

# if not, try to start the service manually
#&gt; netctl start wlp2s0-YourWiFi-NAME</code></pre>
        <p>
          Once we have a usable network, we can download <strong>archibold.sh</strong> installer.
        </p>
        <pre><code>curl -O http://archibold.io/sh/archibold.sh</code></pre>
        <p>
          The file <code>archibold.sh</code> should be in the folder now.<br/>
          Sometimes you need this operation twice (fancy DNS redirects).<br/>
          Use <code>ls</code> to verify it's in the list or run pevious command again.<br/>
          Before launching it, we need to understand how to configure it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="configuring-the-installer">
          <a href="#configuring-the-installer">Configuring the installer</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are few options so far for this installer, all listed here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>USER</strong>, mandatory user name. It must be lowercase!<br/>
            Pick your twitter handler if you don't know which one to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DISK</strong>, mandatory destination path.<br/>
            It must be the driver letter where <em>archibold</em> is going to be installed.<br/>
            Please note <strong>this disk will be completely erased</strong> so be sure it's the right one.<br/>
            In order to know which is the right target we can use <code>fdisk -l</code>.<br/>
            Be careful, the current booting ArchLinux will be listed too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SWAP</strong>, optional amount, by default <code>2G</code>.<br/>
            To avoid creation of a swap partition use <code>SWAP=0</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GNOME</strong>, optional, if <code>GNOME=0</code> will skip the Desktop environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LABEL</strong>, optional boot name, by default <strong>archibold</strong>.<br/>
            It might be completely ignored by your system, I wouldn't bother much ;-)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once we understand the meaning of these variables, we can simply launch the installer as such:
        </p>
        <pre><code>DISK=/dev/sdX USER=archibold sh archibold.sh</code></pre>
        <p>
          From now on, we can simply follow instructions. Here a summary of what we'll need to do:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            confirm provided details are those we meant, and press <strong>y</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            once asked, provide the <strong>root password</strong> and confirm it twice
          </li>
          <li>
            after that, provide the <strong>chosen user password</strong> and confirm it twice
          </li>
          <li>
            wait until everything has been installed, reaching <strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong>.<br/>
            Type at this point the following in console: <code>shutdown -h now</code> and remove the USB after.<br/>
            We can reboot the device without any USB stick now, <strong>archibold</strong> has been installed!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If everything worked smoothly, the first screen should show the <code>USER</code> name.<br/>
          Clicking on it, will reveal the input to put the password asked during installation.<br/>
          Write it down and reach the Desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Settings</strong> are reachable through the top right corner.<br/>
          One click and few essential options will show up already.

        <p>
          <strong>Programs</strong> are reachable trough the top left corner, or using the Window/Start button.<br/>
          We can simply start typing a program name, and this will be listed on the screen.

          Clicking the settings icon, here a suggested list of possible actions to take:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>touchpad settings</strong>, in case on laptop, click on Mouse &amp; Touchpad and switch everything on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>automatic login</strong>, actually not recommended, but easy to reach via Users.<br/>
            We need to unlock the ON/OFF button and put the USER password. Lock again once done.

        <p>
          <em>archibold</em> comes with <strong>gnome-tweak</strong> tool by default.<br/>
          Use the Window/Start button or reach the top left corner and type <strong>tweak</strong>.<br/>
          Click on the Tweak Tool icon and check at least these:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Appearance</strong>, the Globl Dark Theme is gorgeous and it's ON by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Desktop</strong>, Icons on Desktop, ON by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extensions</strong>, Applications Menu to discover all you have installed.<br/>
            This might slow down boot time hence it's OFF by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Top Bar</strong>, Show date too, not just the time, ON by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dark Terminal</strong>, actually out of Tweak. Launch the Terminal then:<br/>
            Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Use dark theme variant, which is ON by default.

        <p>
          The default browser that works out of the box is Epiphany, also known as GNOME Web browser.<br/>
          This is both a very beautiful and deadly simple to use browser.<br/>
          It's also so sleek it has been used in <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> as default browser for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/web-browser-released/">Raspberry Pi</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, many web developers do not test their sites in this browser.<br/>
          As result, those sites might provide an annoying, or broken, experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your favorite sites work already there's no need to change browser.<br/>
          In all other cases, please follow these instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best external browser, with also a good HiDPI support, is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.<br/>
          You hear me right, Firefox, not Chrome or Chromium: Firefox!<br/>
          To install it, launch the terminal and write the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code>sudo pacman -S --needed firefox
# first time will ask the USER password with a warning
# all other times will simply ask the password only</code></pre>
        <p>
          Accept dependencies that need to be installed and after that, type <code>firefox</code> and press enter.
        </p>

          <a href="#hidpi-firefox">HiDPI Firefox</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If your device uses a HiDPi/retina like display, you might see everything too small.<br/>
          Just type in the Firefox URL bar, as if it was a website, the following: <code>about:config</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please <strong>be careful</strong>, there's a lot to configure here but we need to change only one value!
        </p>
        <p>
          Search <em>pixel</em> and change the value of <code>layout.css.devPixelPerPx</code> to <strong>2</strong>.<br/>
          Apply and eventually restart Firefox.

        <p>
          It's embarrassing in 2015 there are still websites requiring Flash player.<br/>
          However, if this is the case, you might try to install it for Firefox via:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Broadcom WiFi</strong> problems. The hybrid driver works quite OK if patched.<br/>
            This is <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl-dkms/">the suggested AUR</a> package to install for these kind of WiFi cards.<br/>
            In order to know which one you have, write this on the terminal: <code>lspci -nn</code><br/>
            You should have a list of devices, one of them called Wireless Network/Adapter.<br/>
            If you are sure you need such driver, you can simply type: <code>aur broadcom-wl-dkms</code> in the terminal.

            A <i>way-too-quick</i> introduction would be the following, to be typed via the Terminal:
            <pre><code># to update everything in the system
sudo pacman -Syu

# to search a specific package online
sudo pacman -Ss <i>package-name</i>

# to install a specific package
sudo pacman -S <i>package-name</i>

# to install a specific package
# without reinstalling its dependencies
sudo pacman -S --needed <i>package-name</i>

# to know if a package is installed or search one locally
sudo pacman -Qs <i>package-name</i>

# to remove a package and its dependencies
sudo pacman -Rsc <i>package-name</i>

# to clean old packages cache
sudo pacman -Sc</code></pre>
          </li>

          I'd like to say all this is brought to you by me, truth is, I've basically done nothing here.<br/>
          The community behind <strong>ArchLinux</strong> is one of the most active I know.<br/>
          The quality of the documentation they produce is simply stunning and I <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/donate/">encourage you to donate</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also strongly suggest to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/friends/">become a friend of GNOME</a>.<br/>
          These two projects are making Linux Desktop a reality.<br/>
          You'll love <strong>GNOME</strong>, its interface, and all it has to offer.<br/>
          You'll love how snappy, essential, and well documented is also ArchLinux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I am not taking a cent here, this is rather me giving back what I've taken from them.<br/>
          Stay tuned for future updates. You can also follow this project <a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/archibold.io">on GitHub</a>.<br/>
          Best Regards, Andrea Giammarchi.
